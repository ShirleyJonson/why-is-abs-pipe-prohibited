If you want to do your own plumbing, ABS pipe fittings are very helpful. ABS is cheap and easy to use, making it a great material for a beginning DIY plumber to work with.

**What is ABS pipe?**
---------------------

ABS, or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, is a black plastic pipe that is commonly used for drainage, sewage, and vents. It is also often used in DWV systems (drain-waste-vent), which are designed to remove wastewater from a home or business.

The reason it is ideal for these applications is that it is extremely durable and can withstand high temperatures, making it resistant to both chemical and physical damage. Additionally, it is not susceptible to corrosion like metal pipes are, so it will not rust over time.

However, one potential downside of using ABS pipe is that it contains a chemical known as BPA, or bisphenol A, which has been linked to various health concerns. The BPA is a plastic hardening agent, which helps to preserve the lifespan of the pipe but can also leach into the water that flows through it.

**Shut Off the Water Valve**
----------------------------

It is easy to forget things that are unrelated to the materials you have at hand, but there are important safety precautions you should take before working with your pipes. The most important one is turning off your water. Use your home's main shutoff valve to do this, and then test out the appliance you will be working with to ensure that the water is completely shut off. This will also empty the pipes of water, which is very helpful as well.

Cutting ABS Pipes
-----------------

Measure the desired location of the pipe, and measure and mark the pipe to the appropriate length. Next, cut the pipe according to the measurements you have taken. You can use several tools for this, so simply choose whichever you have available. A plastic pipe cutter is great, but a fine-toothed saw or hacksaw works perfectly well.

**Deburring the Pipes**
-----------------------

The ABS pipe will not be perfectly smooth at the end. This is normal, but it is important to fix the problem appropriately. Never use sandpaper on a plastic pipe, as it can make the problems worse, or remove enough material that your pipe will be shorter than you intended it to be. Instead, use a deburring tool. This tool is specifically made for your problem and will work reliably to give you a smooth pipe that is easy to work with.

Preparing the Pipes and Fittings
--------------------------------

At this point, you are ready to fit your pipe and pipe fitting together. Apply your solvent cement to the inside of your ABS pipe fitting and also onto the tip of the pipe you are connecting to it.

Your cement of choice should be specifically labeled as intended for use with ABS, as not all are, and an incorrectly chosen cement can damage your pipe fittings. You should add plenty of cement to the end of your pipe and relatively little to the ABS fitting.

Once you have applied the cement, push the pipe into the fitting and turn it slightly. This makes it easier to fit the pipe and pipe fitting together and align properly. In under a minute, the cement will harden, leaving you with a firmly attached pipe.
